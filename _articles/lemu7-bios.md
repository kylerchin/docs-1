This BIOS update enables VT-x for virtualization on your Lemur.  These instructions only apply to the Lemur 7. They do not apply to any other model of computer we sell.

This will update your BIOS to version 1.05.14RSA4/EC 1.05.02SA3.

### Prerequisites

1. If you have a BIOS/UEFI password set, clear it prior to updating. This can be done by editing your Supervisor/Boot passwords and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> when prompted for a new password.

2. Remove all external USB drives and devices.

3. Ensure your computer is set to boot with UEFI enabled in the Boot menu.

### Updating BIOS

1. Download the [lemu7.zip](/files/firmware/lemu7-bios.zip) file, unzip it, and put all of the files on the root of a MBR FAT32 formatted USB flash drive.

2. Connect AC power to the laptop. AC power is required to update.

3. Restart your Lemur and hold <kbd>F7</kbd> during boot.  Choose the USB drive from the boot menu.

4. At the prompt, type in `fs1:` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (this switches to the USB drive to run the updates).

5. Type in `meset` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  This unlocks the ME for flashing.  The computer will turn off and reboot.  The fans will be at 100% for the next steps.  If they are not, please plug in AC power and try again.

6. Hold <kbd>F7</kbd> to boot from USB again.  Type in `fs1:` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

7. Type in `flashme` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  This will flash the ME, and then the BIOS.  The computer will then turn off.

8. Hold <kbd>F7</kbd> to boot from USB again.  Type in `fs1:` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

9. Type in `ecflash` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  This will flash the EC.  The computer will turn off.

10. Hold <kbd>F7</kbd> to boot from USB again.  Type in `fs1:` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

11. Type in `eol` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  This will lock the ME again.  The computer will turn off.

Enjoy using your Lemur with the fancy new BIOS!
